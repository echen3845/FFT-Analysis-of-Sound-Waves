# FFT-Analysis-of-Sound-Waves
This report explores the analysis of sound waves through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The 
experiment included transforming sinusoidal, square, and natural sound waveforms from the time 
domain to the frequency domain. By examining FFT spectra, we analyzed the fundamental frequencies, 
harmonics, and beat patterns of different sound sources, including tuning forks, whistles, the human 
voice, and musical instruments. Through this, we gained insight into the physical and physiological 
origins of these sounds, and how they can be characterized by varying frequency composition and 
amplitudes.
